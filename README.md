Another main user in this system is admin, which is given the privilege to remove parcel or view parcel based on slot (House A1-A10). Receiver is able to pickup, drop off and view parcel lists in their own slot(houseID). Sender on the other hand only gets to drop off the parcel in the slot(A1-A10) needed.
